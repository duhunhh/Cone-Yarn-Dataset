Cone-Yarn-Dataset is a data set for cone yarn varieties recognition and cone yarn defect detection. Image data is sourced from a textile company in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, China. Considering the wide variety of cone yarns and the limited number of cone yarn batches in a textile factory at any given time, the data collection was divided into two stages. The first stage collected 6 classes in October 2024; the second stage collected 9 classes in December 2024. During the production process, due to the repeated use of bobbins and the compression caused by stacking, some bobbins were damaged. These damaged images were included in the dataset, resulting in a final collection of 3000 cone yarn images. The 3000 original images were divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio, resulting in 1800 images for training, 600 for validation, and 600 for testing.
